# Git Workflow

## Commit Standards
- Uses conventional commits
- Prefers feature branches
- Code review through PRs
- Uses semantic versioning

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing features
- Use t-wada's recommended method for TDD

## File Organization
- If creating intermediate files during the session, place them under `./claude/tmp/`
- The intermediate output will also be created in `.claude/tmp/`
- Suggest moving outside `.claude/tmp/` when necessary
